# Arch-Scripts

Collection of scripts for my arch linux installations

#### CoreBoost

Disables the CPU turbo boost (Intel) in order to keeps things a little cooler.
See the `coreboost` [readme](coreboost/coreboost.md) for more details.

#### MBP Brighness patch

Quick patched `apple-gmux` kernel module [installation](mbp-brightness-patch/README.md). 
Use as long as the vanilla release breaks brightness control on the MacBook Pro 2015.
